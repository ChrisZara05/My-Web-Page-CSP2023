        <li>GOAL: To make 5 pannels in css with a specific distance and color.</li>
        <li>Process: In order to complete this assignment I had to play around with the properties of the table tag in css. I made 10 table rows however only five were filled in with color and the blank rows were used to create spacing using the padding tag in css.</li>
